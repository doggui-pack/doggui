## 💭 Inspiration and motivation
The creation of Doggui was mainly motivated by the lack of (pre-built) color palettes available for a variety of applications. Most of the themes present in each of the applications used by Doggui led me to create my own color palette to meet as many needs as possible. Doggui's inspiration was mainly driven by the Catppuccin theme. 

&nbsp;

## 🧠 Design Philosophy
- Doggui's themes are intended to be as free as possible. I.e., we want the themes to be able to go anywhere, but not to be monotonous or sad.
- We try to keep as many colors as possible that go together. We want each color to coexist with the other, without creating a color discrepancy such as one that's too bright or too dull in relation to the theme.
- We try to keep the color palette modern and colorful, so that everyone can appreciate it.
- Our aim is for color palettes to be used mainly in simple themes, without being filled to overflowing.

&nbsp;

## 🎨 Palette
Doggui currently comprises 3 different palettes, each with a different spirit. You can see them below. Their names refer to the breeds of dog to which they might be assigned.

You're free to use our palettes to your heart's content and modify them as you see fit. If you've created a color palette that you think belongs in Doggui, then feel free to send us a request.

We also try to spread Doggui's themes as widely as possible. So we create themes for as many applications as possible. You too can now publish a Doggui theme you've made for an application.
